# Fixes Implemented - LinK Project

## 🔧 **Issues Resolved**

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Runtime Error: `_badge$earnedAt.toLocaleDateString is not a function`**

**Problem:** Date objects were being serialized as strings in localStorage, causing type errors when trying to call Date methods.

**Solution:**
- **Fixed in `frontend/src/components/deaf/ProgressDashboard.tsx`:**
  - Line 295: Changed `badge.earnedAt?.toLocaleDateString()` to `new Date(badge.earnedAt).toLocaleDateString()`
  - Line 370: Changed `quiz.completedAt.toLocaleDateString()` to `new Date(quiz.completedAt).toLocaleDateString()`

- **Enhanced date handling in `frontend/src/utils/deafStore.ts`:**
  - Added proper Date serialization/deserialization in Zustand persist middleware
  - Ensured `completedAt` is always a proper Date object when adding quiz results

### 2. ✅ **Fixed AI Tools and Chat Agent Connectivity**

**Problem:** Tools and AI agent weren't working due to backend server not running.

**Solutions:**
- **Started Backend Server:** 
  - Backend now running on port 8000: `http://localhost:8000`
  - All AI services initialized (Gemini, Hugging Face, ElevenLabs, Tesseract)
  
- **Updated API Endpoints:**
  - Changed `frontend/src/pages/Tools.tsx`: API_BASE_URL to `http://localhost:8000/api`
  - Changed `frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx`: API_BASE_URL to `http://localhost:8000/api`

- **Simplified Backend Configuration:**
  - Removed MongoDB dependency for development
  - Backend now works with file-based storage
  - Health check endpoint working: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced User Profile Experience**

**Improvements:**
- **Added Sample Data Feature:** Users can now click "Add Demo Data" to populate their profile with:
  - Sample quiz results (90%, 80%, 100% scores)
  - Progress in flashcards (15/50), alphabet (8/26), common signs (12/100)
  - 3-day learning streak
  - Earned badges for achievements

- **Fixed Date Display Issues:** All dates now display correctly in user profiles and progress dashboards
